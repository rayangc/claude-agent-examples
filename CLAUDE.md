# Project Instructions

## Context
Learning the Claude Agent SDK by building focused examples. See `plan.md` for progress and next steps.

## On Startup
1. Read `plan.md` to understand progress
2. Check completed `learnings.md` files for context
3. Continue with the next ⏳ UP NEXT module

## When Running Examples
- Log full output to `./output-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.log` (e.g., `output-20260119-1024.log`)
- Use: `npm run <script> 2>&1 | tee output-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).log`

## Communication Style
- Be concise in explanations and learnings
- Keep `learnings.md` files focused and scannable
- Use tables and bullet points over prose
- Skip obvious details; focus on insights and gotchas
